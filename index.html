<h1>God Tid</h1>

Eventually there will be a web site here for the sailing boat "God Tid", currently moored up in Sandessundet, Tromsø, Norway.  As for now there are some information at <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h58e2Fs9x75YZp_WqEt22ACRpuRs3nsnVmFpTLMYPLY/edit">google docs</a> and a draft of an <a href="http://tobias.u.bitbit.net/God-Tid-agreement">owners agreement</a> at etherpad.
<p>
"God Tid" literally means "Good Time" - it's sort of having a double meaning, one can have a good time onboard a sailing boat, and one needs plenty of time ("god tid") to get anywhere.  That has particularly been true when drifting around in very calm weather and without a working engine.  I've even had to tow it by the dhingy as fast as I could in the very early morning a normal working day, just to get to the office in time ... :-)
