The boat is currently on land - but not entirely like planned: <a href="http://www.nordlys.no/nyheter/article6309032.ece">http://www.nordlys.no/nyheter/article6309032.ece</a>.

<h2>About the boat</h2>

"God Tid" literally means "Good Time" - it's sort of having a double meaning, one can have a good time onboard a sailing boat, and one needs plenty of time ("god tid") to get anywhere.  That has particularly been true when drifting around in very calm weather and without a working engine.  I've even had to tow it by the dhingy as fast as I could in the very early morning a normal working day, just to get to the office in time ... :-)
