<h1>God Tid</h1>

<h2>Oups - update 2012-10-26</h2>

The boat is currently on land - but not entirely like planned: http://www.nordlys.no/nyheter/article6309032.ece

Any helping hands is appreciated.  I'm not in Tromsø myself and I'm a bit clueless on what I'll do next.  At least I think it should be pulled more to land when the tide is at it's highest, or I'm concerned it will get more destroyed at every high tide in the upcoming days. :-(  Eventually the insurance company will send a representative Wednessday, but that's a bit late, isn't it?

<h2>About the boat</h2>

"God Tid" literally means "Good Time" - it's sort of having a double meaning, one can have a good time onboard a sailing boat, and one needs plenty of time ("god tid") to get anywhere.  That has particularly been true when drifting around in very calm weather and without a working engine.  I've even had to tow it by the dhingy as fast as I could in the very early morning a normal working day, just to get to the office in time ... :-)
